Navionics Mobile SDK
=====================

## Overview

The Navionics Mobile SDK for iOS allows you to add Navionics cartographic data to your application.
The SDK handles map display, including user gestures such as pan, pinch and tap.
Using overlay objects such as markers, circles, polylines or polygons, you can add your own content to the map.
In addition, it provides APIs to use some services based on cartographic data.
You can get the details of the POIs visible on the map or search for them worldwide using the search feature.

Developing an application with the Navionics Mobile SDK for iOS requires at least Xcode 8.0 with a target SDK of 9.3 or later.
